# result learn react part two
In the second stage of learning React, I extensively utilized `useRef`, a hook that allowed me to access and manipulate the values of DOM elements or components without triggering a re-render. This function proved to be highly effective for specific purposes, enabling me to store values without disrupting the display. Furthermore, delving into hooks overall and implementing the `fetch` API from another website resulted in a deeper understanding of state management and server interactions. With this foundation, I feel more confident in developing React applications that are more dynamic and efficiently connected to external resources.
